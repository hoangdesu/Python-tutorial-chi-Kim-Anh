The ministers were recently organized into a conservative Coalition for the Restoration of the Black Family and Society, with the first item on its agenda being Thomas' confirmation.
(check) A television ad supporting Thomas, shown in four Southern states where senators face re-election campaigns next year, attracted 10,000 calls between Friday and Sunday, according to Gary Bauer, organizer of the conservative Citizens Committee to Confirm Clarence Thomas, which financed the ad's production.
The ad carries a toll-free telephone number that viewers are asked to call to register their support for Thomas; callers are then sorted by states, and the state lists will be sent to the targeted senators.
(check) On the other side of the Thomas confirmation issue, the National Abortion Rights Action League reported that senators had begun to receive the first of 500,000 anti-Thomas post cards the group has provided to the constituents of targeted lawmakers whose votes against Thomas' confirmation are regarded as critical.
(check) The Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, a bipartisan group organized in 1963 to assist the government in civil-rights law enforcement, announced that 86 of about 110 members of its board of directors had decided to oppose Thomas' confirmation.
The announcement said Thomas' legal philosophy reflected a "hostility to and rejection of the core of civil rights jurisprudence" .
