One result of the bungled coup is that Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev -- even though reinstated as head of state -- "could be irrelevant" to what happens next, analysts said.
Even before Gorbachev returned to Moscow, they predicted his future would be limited to a figurehead role.
"He lost by being peripheral to what happened.
No one really came to Gorbachev's assistance as leader of the country," one U.S. official said.
Instead, opposition to the coup was based on "the illegality of the principle" of usurping power and widespread fear that if Gorbachev could be "rolled up," then other democratically elected leaders could be, too.
In the aftermath of the coup, analysts also predicted that:; (check) Major constraints on Soviet cooperation with the West, such as the military's disaffection with Gorbachev's support of Bush's strategy during the Persian Gulf war, will now be greatly weakened or removed, although "a benign" Soviet Union cannot be assumed in every case.
(check) The coup's abrupt end opened the way for faster democratic reforms, but it will not now "create Jeffersonian democracy -- or maybe ever."; (check) The Communist Party is "dead" and will no longer be a political force, although most of the country's bureaucrats are current or former party members.
(check) Gorbachev is likely to abandon the party and move more aggressively toward reform .
